    This is a Mastermind algorithm implementation with constant size memory.
	<br/>
	Here there is a memory restriction for the algorithm, where we are allowed only two strings, viz. x and y in the memory to store our data. 
	<br/>
	The main strategy would be that of figuring the right combination of block string from the x memory and forgetting the data from x memory after that.
