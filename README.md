    This is a Mastermind algorithm implementation with constant size memory.
	<br/>
	Here there is a memory restriction for the algorithm, where we are allowed only two strings, viz. x and y in the memory to store our data. 
	<br/>
	The main strategy would be that of figuring the right combination of block string from the x memory and forgetting the data from x memory after that.

	<b>Instructions to run the file : </b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Put your input file inside the 'input' folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			Run the command "python mastermind.py your_input_file_name" where your_input_file_name is the name of the input file
		</li>	
		<li>
			3 input files are already there in the input folder. So you can run "<b>python mastermind input1.txt</b>" , "<b>python mastermind input2.txt</b>" and "<b>python mastermind input3.txt</b>". 
			<ul>
				<li> 
					input1.txt is a short string where the length is 10 and the number of colors,k = 4.
				</li>	
				<li>
					input2.txt is a very long string where length is around 3600 and number of colors, k = 4.
				</li>
				<li>
					input3.txt is a very long string where length is around 3600 and number of colors, k = 10.
				</li>

			</ul>
