    This is a Mastermind algorithm implementation with constant size memory.
	<br/>
	Here there is a memory restriction for the algorithm, where we are allowed only two strings, viz. x and y in the memory to store our data. 
	<br/>
	The main strategy would be that of figuring the right combination of block string from the x memory and forgetting the data from x memory after that.

	<b>Instructions to run the file : </b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Put your input file inside the 'input' folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			Run the command "python mastermind.py your_input_file_name" where your_input_file_name is the name of the input file
		</li>	
		<li>
			3 input files are already there in the input folder. So you can run "python mastermind input1.txt" , "python mastermind input2.txt" and "python mastermind input3.txt"
		</li>	
	</ul>
